# Compounding Engineering Plugin (DSPy Edition)

A Python implementation of the [Compounding Engineering Plugin](https://github.com/EveryInc/compounding-engineering-plugin) using [DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy).

## What Is Compounding Engineering?

**Each unit of engineering work should make subsequent units of work easier—not harder.**

This CLI tool provides AI-powered development tools for code review, planning, and workflow automation, following the compounding engineering philosophy. It is designed as a **Local-First** tool that runs on your machine, keeping your code secure while leveraging powerful LLMs.

## Features

- **🔍 Multi-Agent Code Review**: Run 10+ specialized review agents in parallel
  - **Security Sentinel**: Detects vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, etc.)
  - **Performance Oracle**: Identifies bottlenecks and O(n) issues
  - **Architecture Strategist**: Reviews design patterns and SOLID principles
  - **Data Integrity Guardian**: Checks transaction safety and validation
  - And many more...

- **🤖 ReAct File Editing**: Intelligent file operations with reasoning
  - **Smart Tools**: List, search, read ranges, and edit specific lines
  - **Iterative Reasoning**: Think → Act → Observe → Iterate pattern
  - **Zero Hallucination**: Direct file manipulation, not text generation

- **🛡️ Secure Work Execution**: Safely execute AI-generated plans
  - **Isolated Worktrees**: Optional `--worktree` mode for safe parallel execution
  - **Parallel Processing**: Multi-threaded todo resolution with `--workers`
  - **Flexible Modes**: In-place (default) or isolated worktree execution

- **📋 Smart Planning**: Transform feature descriptions into detailed plans
  - Repository research & pattern analysis
  - Framework documentation integration
  - SpecFlow user journey analysis

- **✅ Interactive Triage**: Manage code review findings
  - **Batch Operations**: Approve multiple findings at once
  - **Smart Priorities**: Auto-detection of P1/P2/P3 severity
  - **Work Logs**: Tracks decisions and rationale automatically

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (fast Python package installer):

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Dan-StrategicAutomation/dspy-compounding-engineering.git
cd dspy-compounding-engineering

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Ollama)

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

## Roadmap & Missing Features

While the core agentic workflows are fully functional, some integrations present in the original plugin are currently **unimplemented** or **simplified**:

- ❌ **GitHub Integration**: Currently, the tool does not create GitHub Issues, post PR comments, or manage GitHub Projects. It operates entirely on local files.
- ❌ **Smart Context Gathering**: The planning workflow uses a basic file listing strategy. It does not yet use vector search or smart dependency graph analysis to find relevant context.
- ❌ **Comprehensive Testing**: While `work.py` runs tests, there is no robust test runner integration or coverage reporting.
- ❌ **IDE Integration**: No VS Code or JetBrains plugins yet.

## Configuration

Edit `.env` to configure your LLM provider:

```bash
# OpenAI
DSPY_LM_PROVIDER=openai
DSPY_LM_MODEL=gpt-4o
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Anthropic
DSPY_LM_PROVIDER=anthropic
DSPY_LM_MODEL=claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# Ollama (Local)
DSPY_LM_PROVIDER=ollama
DSPY_LM_MODEL=qwen2.5-coder:14b
```

## Usage

### 1. Review Code

Run a comprehensive multi-agent review on your current changes:

```bash
# Review latest local changes
uv run python cli.py review

# Review entire project (not just changes)
uv run python cli.py review --project

# Review a specific PR (requires gh cli)
uv run python cli.py review https://github.com/user/repo/pull/123
```

### 2. Triage Findings

Process the findings generated by the review:

```bash
uv run python cli.py triage
```

- **Yes**: Approve and convert to ready todo
- **Next**: Skip or delete
- **All**: Batch approve all remaining items
- **Custom**: Change priority or details

### 3. Work on Todos or Plans

Unified command for resolving todos or executing plans using ReAct agents:

```bash
# Resolve all P1 priority todos
uv run python cli.py work p1

# Resolve specific todo by ID
uv run python cli.py work 001

# Execute a plan file
uv run python cli.py work plans/feature.md

# Preview changes without applying (dry run)
uv run python cli.py work p1 --dry-run

# Use isolated worktree (safe parallel execution)
uv run python cli.py work p1 --worktree

# Control parallelization
uv run python cli.py work p2 --sequential  # Sequential execution
uv run python cli.py work p2 --workers 5   # 5 parallel workers
```

This will:

1. Auto-detect input type (todo ID, plan file, or pattern)
2. Use ReAct reasoning for intelligent file operations
3. Execute in-place (default) or in isolated worktree (`--worktree`)
4. Process todos in parallel (default) or sequentially (`--sequential`)
5. Mark todos as complete (`*-complete-*.md`)
6. Clean up worktrees automatically

### 4. Generate Commands

Generate shell commands from natural language descriptions:

```bash
# Generate a command
uv run python cli.py generate-command "find all Python files modified in the last week"

# Execute the generated command (use with caution)
uv run python cli.py generate-command "list large files" --execute
```

### 5. Plan New Features

Generate a detailed implementation plan:

```bash
uv run python cli.py plan "Add user authentication with OAuth"
```

### 6. Codify Learnings

Capture and codify learnings into the knowledge base:

```bash
uv run python cli.py codify "Always validate user input before database operations"
uv run python cli.py codify "Use factory pattern for agent creation" --source retro
```

## Philosophy

Based on the [Compounding Engineering](https://every.to/source-code/my-ai-had-already-fixed-the-code-before-i-saw-it) philosophy:

- **Plan → Delegate → Assess → Codify**
- Systematic beats heroic
- Quality compounds over time
